Version Big Ideas:

Version 1:
The core function of the game. This version will be completely text based and have no map/story, but all game functions should work properly

Version 2:
This version will include Key Logging. Instead of using a scanner and having to press enter to complete actions, all input will be taken by a single key-pressed

Version 3:
This is where things get tricky and we start to move off text based things and into graphics. I haven't really thought this far ahead yet and future version big ideas are TBD




VERSION 1:

Already Completed Features:

Basic structure of the game
Constructing of Pokemon and Moves based off an API
Battle mechanics (Against wild pokemon)
Damage calculation
Stat calculation
Typing and multipliers
Stat changing moves
Trainer v Trainer battling
Switching Pokemon (Both user and opponenet)
Gaining xp, Leveling up, Learning moves from leveling


To-Do List:

Evolving
Wild Pokemon AI (Something other than random)
Trainer AI (Including smart switching)
ALL Bag Items (Including: Health Restores, Battle Items, Pokeballs)
Catching a pokemon
Status Effects! (Burned, Poisoned, Paralyzed, Frozen, Asleep)

Included in the big idea but I have no clue how to do these:

Held Items
Abilities
